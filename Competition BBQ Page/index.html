            Competition BBQ is a world of its own and is what separates the pitmasters from the backyard grillers. To compete, pitmasters must cook the following flavor profile categories- chicken, ribs, pork, and brisket. Contestants then present six succulent servings to a panel of certified judges to determine a winner.
